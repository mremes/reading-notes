LEARNING GOALS
Can explain
  MAC-address
   bit error detection and correction
   ARP-protocol
   reserving transfer channel and usage
   combining computers into a local network

THE LINK LAYER
the link layer is implemented on top of a driver and is attached to e.g. a PCIE expansion slot.
one bit errors are checked with the Hamming Code.
when there is an error, either "ask" for a new block or do correction with extra check bits (Reed-Salomon).
  Hamming Code was covered in the Computer Organisation course
  correction is not part of learning goals
check the whole block with checksums – not performant
CRC – easy to implement with hardware and is reliable
  polynomic arithmetic (polynomial code)
  many check bits, can identify torrents of errors
  virittäjäpolynomi
there are severals but both sender and receiver must use the same mechamism

SHARED CHANNELS
point-to-point (kaksipisteyhteys)
  ppp-protocol, dial-up access
  less collisions
broadcast
  more collisions
the trend is towards point-to-point
hub-based networks
only one can send at once, otherwise, kakofonia prevails. there will be bit mess if multiple senders at once

multiple access protocol can handle those
can send all at once and utilise the whole channel and everyone gets same amount of time
the goal is to do it simply and cheaply (?)
channel division protocols (use this, I use that)
  random access protocols
aloha uses randomisation and is very inefficient (16-37 % utilization rate)
carrier sense multiple access (csma) waits (for a random time) current transfer to complete before hijacking the channel
csma/collision detection: checks for collision signals in the channel (different signal amplitude)
that's why coaxial cables can be max N metres long (so that less collisions happen)

MAC (MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL) ADDRESSES, maca, 6  bits
a.k.a. lan address, physical address, device address, ethernet address, ...
attached at the manufacturing time of the network card
  an analogy for addresses: ip ~ street name  mac ~ ss number
it's possible to change programmatically
  mac spoofing
  IEEE provides macas (/w a single ieee bit mask, can create 17 m different addresses)
  broadcast / default maca: 00-00-00-00-00-00
provide mac address to computers in the local network
using arp, resolve the mac addresses
each router and host has a mapping table (analogous to dns [name discovery protocol, ndp])
  ip;mac;ttl
  ttl is typically 20 m
  broadcast message to get info from other hosts
  obviously, the edge router of the local network knows mac addresses
  mac src, dst change after passing a router; ips stay the same

ETHERNET
simple, cheap and easy to extend routers and switches
ieee-standardized lan network
  classic 10 mbps
  fast 100 mbps
  gigabit 1000 mbps
  ...
other local network standards
  wlan
  fddi
  token ring
must be less than 100 m to the hub
network cards handle collisions
switches are more and more used to create point-to-point connections (and get rid off collisions)
preample is included in an ethernet frame
data minimum is 46 bits
  6 bits for tcp/ip data (fill if needed)
  to handle collisions
switch can handle different sending rates, hub cannot
  store and forward, buffering
  if not found in table then broadcast (flooding)
  self-learning

WIRELESS LINKS
challenges are
  hosts changing networks
  signals soften ja reflect
  other signals disturb
802.11.\d – ieee standards for wifi
mobile networks are different
ad hoc networks
  self-organising
  bluetooth: 802.15.1
  hotspot
   collisions when networks align partially
no collision detection (csma/cd)
collision avoidance (csma/ca)

questions
  how to build a local network?
  ip vs mac address
  arp protocol vs arp table
  backwards learning and switch table
  detecting bit errors
  crc
  sending channel split
  csma/cd
