LEARNING GOALS
Can explain
  MAC-address
   bit error detection and correction
   ARP-protocol
   reserving transfer channel and usage
   combining computers into a local network

THE LINK LAYER
the link layer is implemented on top of a driver and is attached to e.g. a PCIE expansion slot.
one bit errors are checked with the Hamming Code.
when there is an error, either "ask" for a new block or do correction with extra check bits (Reed-Salomon).
  Hamming Code was covered in the Computer Organisation course
  correction is not part of learning goals
check the whole block with checksums – not performant
CRC – easy to implement with hardware and is reliable
  polynomic arithmetic (polynomial code)
  many check bits, can identify torrents of errors
  virittäjäpolynomi
there are severals but both sender and receiver must use the same mechamism

SHARED CHANNELS
point-to-point (kaksipisteyhteys)
  ppp-protocol, dial-up access
  less collisions
broadcast
  more collisions
the trend is towards point-to-point
hub-based networks
only one can send at once, otherwise, kakofonia prevails. there will be bit mess if multiple senders at once

multiple access protocol can handle those
can send all at once and utilise the whole channel and everyone gets same amount of time
the goal is to do it simply and cheaply (?)
channel division protocols (use this, I use that)
  random access protocols
aloha uses randomisation and is very inefficient (16-37 % utilization rate)
carrier sense multiple access (csma) waits (for a random time) current transfer to complete before hijacking the channel
csma/collision detection: checks for collision signals in the channel (different signal amplitude)
that's why coaxial cables can be max N metres long (so that less collisions happen)

MAC (MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL) ADDRESSES, maca
a.k.a. lan address, physical address, device address, ethernet address, ...
attached at the manufacturing time of the network card
  an analogy for addresses: ip ~ street name  mac ~ ss number
it's possible to change programmatically
  mac spoofing
  IEEE provides macas (/w a single ieee bit mask, can create 17 m different addresses)
  broadcast / default maca: 00-00-00-00-00-00
